# GPR - Motion Modelling 
This repository is a fork of Christoph Jud's *Basic Gaussian process regression library* implementation in C++.

The code was amended specifically for ultrasound-based respiratory motion modelling using:
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and
* a linear autoregressive (AR) model for prediction the respiratory state ahead of time.

## Input:
* config files
* folder containing US images of the liver (input for GPR)
* folder containing deformation vector fields (DVF) of the thorax (output of GPR)
* destination folder

## Requirements:
* General reqiuirements are listed below
* Python requirements are listed in scripts/requirements.txt

# GPR - Basic Gaussian Process Library

Basic Gaussian process regression library. (Eigen3 required)

## Features
	* Multivariate Gaussian process regression
	* Calculation of the derivative at a point
	* Calculation of the uncertainty at a point
	* Save and Load the Gaussian process to/from files
	* Kernels: White, Gaussian, Periodic, RationalQuadratic, Sum and Product
	* Derivative of the kernels
	* Likelihood functions: Gaussian Log Likelihood (incl. derivative wrt. kernel parameter)
	* Prior distributions: Gaussian, Inverse Gaussian, Gamma (incl. sampling, cdf and inverse cdf)
	* Prior distributions can be built by providing their mode and variance



## Getting Started
	To setup the library clone the git repository first
	```
	git clone https://github.com/ChristophJud/GPR.git
	```

	The building of GPR is based on [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/). So navigate to the main directory GPR and create a build directory.
	```
	mkdir build	# create a build directory
	cd build
	ccmake ..	# ccmake is an easy tool to set config parameters
	```
	Set the build type and the installation directory and
	```
	CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS		-std=c++11
	```

	Since GPR depends on the matrix library [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) provide its include directory
	```
	EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR	/path/to/eigen/eigen-3.2.4/install/include/eigen3
	```

	If not all required [Boost](http://www.boost.org) libraries are found on the system provide a custom installation
	```
	Boost_INCLUDE_DIR 	/path/to/boost/boost_1_57_0/
	Boost_LIBRARY_DIR	/path/to/boost/boost_1_57_0/stage/lib/

	```
	Make sure that boost has been built with C++11 by adding ```cxxflags="-std=c++11"``` to the ```b2``` command.

	Finally, type
	```
	make install -j8
	```
	and the library including all test programs will be built.

### Include the library in your own cmake project
	If you want to include the library into your own project the straight forward way is the following:
	Add 
	```
FIND_PACKAGE(GPR REQUIRED)
	``` 
	to your CMakeLists.txt file and provide
	```
	GPR_DIR			/path/to/main/gpr/project/dir/cmake 
	```
	In the CMakeLists.txt you can link your program with ```${GPR_LIBRARIES}```.

## Examples
	The tests can be seen as good examples to how to use the library. 

## TODOs
	* Matrix valued kernels
	* Store/load into/from hdf5 files

## Issues

	GPR itself is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. It depends, however, on other open source projects, which are distributed under different licenses. These are [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) and [Boost](http://www.boost.org).
